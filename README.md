[Apigeelint](https://github.com/apigee/apigeelint) is a Static code analysis tool for Apigee Proxy and SharedFlow bundles to encourage API developers to use best practices and avoid anti-patterns.

This repo contains a set of [External Plugins](https://github.com/apigee/apigeelint#using-external-plugins) for apigeelint that can help identify potential API misconfigurations by checking whether proxies contain required policies.

## Rules

The following rules are currently available:

| Code     | Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EX-BN001 | MisconfigurationCheckAuth       | Check for the presence of `OAuthV2` and/or `VerifyAPIKey` policies in each Proxy Endpoint's PreFlow                                                                                                |
| EX-BN002 | MisconfigurationCheckCORS       | Check for the presence of a `CORS` policy in each Proxy Endpoint's PreFlow                                                                                                                         |
| EX-BN003 | MisconfigurationCheckThreat     | Check for the presence of `JSONThreatProtection` and/or `XMLThreatProtection` policies in each Proxy Endpoint's PreFlow                                                                            |
| EX-BN004 | MisconfigurationCheckMediation  | Check for the presence of `OASValidation` and/or `MessageValidation` policies in each Proxy Endpoint's PreFlow                                                                                     |
| EX-PF001 | RequirePoliciesPreFlowRequest   | Check for the presence of a set of specific named policies in each Proxy Endpoint's PreFlow. This can be used to enforce a naming convention for policies in addition to requiring the policy type |
| EX-PF002 | RequireSharedFlowPreFlowRequest | Check for the usage of specific Shared Flow Bundles called from FlowCallout policies in each Proxy Endpoint's PreFlow                                                                              |

## Requirements

These plugins require apigeelint to be installed. This can be installed using the command:

`npm install --location=global apigeelint`

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/apigeelint for additional details.

## Usage

#### Standalone

To use, clone or download this repository and run `apigeelint` with the `-x` or `--externalPluginsDirectory` option to specify the relative or full path to the `externalPlugins` directory from this repo, e.g.

```
apigeelint -x ./externalPlugins -s path/to/your/apiproxy -f table.js
```

#### VS Code

If you are using VScode, then you can also use these plugins with the [Apigeelint 4 VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andythehood.apigeelint4vscode) extension by selecting the following extension setting:

- `apigeelint.externalPluginsDirectory`: Full path to an external plugins directory (default: none)

## Known Issues

None yet!

## Limitations

The `BN001-BN004` plugins check for presence of the policies in the PreFlow, but do not check whether they are potentially excluded via a `<Condition/>` clause

The `BN001-BN004` plugins don't take into account policies included in Shared Flow Bundles.

The `PF002` plugin does not check for Shared Flow Bundles automatically attached through the use of [Flow Hooks](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-hooks)

## Support

If you find issues, file a ticket here on Github. Keep in mind that there is no
service level agreement (SLA) for responses to these issues. Assume all
responses are on an ad-hoc, volunteer basis.

If you simply have questions, we recommend asking on the [Apigee
